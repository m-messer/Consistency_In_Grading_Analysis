234.0,Class structure and design is well-meaning. ,1,1,"['class', 'design']",Design,0.6666481,"design, segment, functionality, concept, subclass, superclass, method, inheritance, abstraction, interface","[('Design', 0.6666481), ('Abstraction', 0.1666761), ('Inheritance', 0.16667576)]"
565.0,Generally good class design and structure. More shared variables could be put inside the relevant superclass. A lot of commented out code. Some misuse of variable access.,1,1,"['class', 'design', 'superclass', 'misuse']",Inheritance,0.45406517,"method, inheritance, hierarchy, superclass, repetition, abstraction, design, interface, functionality, function","[('Inheritance', 0.45406517), ('Design', 0.40754503), ('Abstraction', 0.13838977)]"
612.0,Generally good code structure and design. Further abstraction can be made between Animal types so that more variables can be shared.,1,1,"['design', 'abstraction']",Design,0.43745133,"design, segment, functionality, concept, subclass, superclass, method, inheritance, abstraction, interface","[('Design', 0.43745133), ('Abstraction', 0.4244314), ('Inheritance', 0.13811725)]"
144.0,Class hierarchy allows addition of more organisms. Food chain class does not seem the best approach. The food chain should be able to be implied from the class hierarchy.,1,1,"['class', 'hierarchy', 'organism', 'food', 'chain', 'class', 'food', 'chain', 'class', 'hierarchy']",Inheritance,0.66657275,"method, inheritance, hierarchy, superclass, repetition, abstraction, design, interface, functionality, function","[('Inheritance', 0.66657275), ('Design', 0.16672319), ('Abstraction', 0.16670409)]"
587.0,some comments are redundant or state the obvious. use a shared Random instance,14,1,"['state', 'instance']",Inheritance,0.33333334,"method, inheritance, hierarchy, superclass, repetition, abstraction, design, interface, functionality, function","[('Inheritance', 0.33333334), ('Design', 0.33333334), ('Abstraction', 0.33333334)]"
